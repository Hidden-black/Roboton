# Roboton
A discord bot I made for fun.
Please note: even though I have made the source code public, I would prefer if you do not run an instance of my bot.\
There are many things which will not work in this bot without a mongodb database. I am sorry I cannot help you to create a database for this bot.\
Please consider [Inviting the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=846035270100320267&permissions=67497024&scope=bot%20applications.commands) instead.\
The code is only provided for educational purposes.
